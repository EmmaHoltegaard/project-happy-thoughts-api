# Project Happy Thoughts API
The aim of this project was to build and API with both GET request endpoints and POST request endpoint connected to database, as well as deal with validation and error handling. This project is linked to a former project, project-happy-thoughts.

## The problem
The project went quite smoothly overall. I was able to follow the instructional materials and build the necessary endpoints/requests from there. I had some problems with deploying on google cloud, but those seem to be resolved, at least for now.
Tools: MongoDB, Mongoose, Express, MongoDB Compass, MongoDB Atlas, Google Cloud.
